Steps:

- create folder called authentication_service
- init a git repository in the folder (git init)
- create README.md, main.py, requirements.txt and folders for tests, auth, docs and scripts
- create virtual environment for the python version you are using (could be a dockerfile as well)
  - "path to python" -m venv ENV_DIR
  - Then inside the virtual environment install the dependencies etc and run your code.
  - add the ENV_DIR to git ignore ´´´echo "ENV_DIR" > .gitignore´´´
  - freeze the requirements that are installed in the virtual environment ´´´pip freeze > requirements.txt´´´
  - type deactivate to jump out of the virtual environment
  - Add git ignore and requirements.txt to repo



pip install -r requirements.txt
